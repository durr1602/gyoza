For every sample (based on samples marked for reporting in the sample layout), raw read counts are plotted as a heatmap.
The x axis corresponds to positions in the mutated protein sequence.
The y axis corresponds to the introduced amino acid residues.
The wild-type nucleotide sequence is excluded from this visualization but its abundance is often much higher compared to variants.
Here, all other variants are shown, which means that a gray square different from a wild-type codon indicates no coverage.
The wild-type protein sequence is indicated by black dots.
