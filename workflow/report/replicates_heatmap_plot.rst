For every combination of attributes and for each output time point, a heatmap indicates the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for every pairwise replicate comparison. It is important to note that a low correlation coefficient is expected for control conditions, i.e. conditions in which we essentially plot noise around zero against noise. Refer to `this figure <replicates_plot.svg_>`_ to check if the absence of correlation is justified.
