Here, we show the change of functional impact scores over time depending on the type of mutation.
This is relevant mostly if your dataset contains more than 1 output time point, but even with only one, you could potentially discern patterns related to the mutation type.
For the toy dataset, we typically observe higher functional impact scores for nonsense variants, and values around 0 for silent mutants.
With a bigger dataset and multiple output time points, you can see the spread of values (standard deviation) for each type of mutation.
