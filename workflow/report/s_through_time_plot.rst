Here, we show the change of functional impact scores over time for high confidence variants depending on the number of amino acid changes (Nham_aa).
The standard deviation indicates the spread of values.
In certain cases, scores deviating from zero (especially if the change scales up through time) for variants encoding the wild-type protein may result from impactful mutations outside the sequenced locus.
