Here, we show an example (with a single combination of "Sample attributes" as specified in the config file) of overlap of unique variants across time points and replicates.
Only the combinations corresponding to >1% of all unique variants are shown.
In a "standard" DMS experiment, we typically observe a strong overlap between input (T0) replicates.
The stacked barplot indicates the number of variants labeled "high confidence" ("1", read count per variant above threshold in all input replicates), "medium" confidence ("2", read count per variant above threshold in at least 1 input replicate) or "low confidence" ("3").
If you are running the workflow on the provided toy dataset, it is normal to observe a large number of "low confidence" variants.
The plot above indicates the average read count in the input.
